> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Always back up your original `content_analyser.py` file before replacing it with the fix!

## 🔧 What’s New in the 3.2 Fix
- ✅ **NSFW model removed completely** — nothing is loaded, evaluated, or scored.  
- ✅ **Frame skipping added** — skips empty/corrupted frames to avoid crashes during processing.  
- ✅ **Safe defaults returned** — keeps FaceFusion’s logic intact with no side effects.  
- ✅ **Clean architecture** — no hacks, no commented-out code, no fragile workarounds.

## 🌟 Why You Should Apply This Fix
- **Total Privacy** – Everything runs locally. No uploads. No online scanning.  
- **Full Control** – Remove NSFW filtering to freely process any content.  
- **No More Breaks** – Future updates won’t disrupt your workflow.  
- **Better Stability** – Skips bad frames, preventing OpenCV crashes like:  
  ```
  D:/a/opencv-python/opencv-python/opencv/modules/imgproc/src/resize.cpp
  ```
- **Improved Performance** – Faster processing by ignoring frames that would otherwise throw errors.

## 🔍 Key Fix Details

### 1. 🛡️ NSFW Check Removed  
The NSFW model has been cleanly removed. No loading, no evaluation, and no scoring. This gives you full creative control and ensures nothing is flagged or limited during processing.

### 2. 🚫 Frame Skipping Added  
Empty or invalid frames often cause crashes in OpenCV, especially when passed to `cv2.resize()`.  
This fix adds a check:
```python
if vision_frame is None or vision_frame.size == 0:
    return None  # skip it
```
This prevents runtime errors and improves stability.

### 3. ⚡ Efficiency Boost  
Skipping bad frames means less wasted processing and faster results, especially on long or low-quality videos.
