Here's the update: In the prepare_frame function, I've added a simple check to make sure the vision_frame isn't None or empty (vision_frame.size == 0) before resizing and processing it. This little fix prevents the OpenCV cv2.resize error that pops up when trying to process an empty frame. It's a small change, but it makes a huge difference!

By removing the NSFW check, you take control of what you create while keeping your data **secure and private**. Perfect for those who want to work freely, without the worry of data being shared or stored elsewhere. üöÄ 
**No more restrictions**, no more waiting, just you, your content, and a tool that works exactly how you want it. Enjoy the power of FaceFusion, now fully under your control. üîí
