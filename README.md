### **Why You Should Apply This Fix üõ†Ô∏è**
- **Total Privacy:** Run FaceFusion entirely locally. Your data stays on your device, and nothing is shared online.
- **Full Control:** Disable the NSFW filter to unlock fast, unrestricted image and video processing.
- **No More Worries:** Never worry about the developers pushing updates that break your workflow or limit your capabilities. With this fix, you're in charge.
- **Speed & Efficiency:** Skip unnecessary checks and enjoy a faster, smoother processing experience. The frame skipping version automatically bypasses any invalid or empty frames, improving performance and **avoiding 
   errors like OpenCV resize errors** (e.g., `D:/a/opencv-python/opencv-python/opencv/modules/imgproc/src/resize.cpp`).
- **Improved Performance:** The `prepare_frame` function has been updated to check if frames are `None` or empty (`frame.size == 0`) before processing, which prevents OpenCV from trying to resize invalid frames and causing errors.

### **Changes & Improvements üîß**

#### **1. NSFW Check Removal:**
By removing the NSFW check, you now have full control over the content you're processing, keeping your data secure and private. No more worrying about content being flagged or shared‚Äîjust you and your content. This makes the tool more flexible and suitable for anyone who doesn't need or want the NSFW filter.

#### **2. Frame Skipping to Prevent OpenCV Errors:**
In the updated `prepare_frame` function, we added a simple check to make sure the `vision_frame` isn't `None` or empty (`vision_frame.size == 0`) before resizing and processing it. This little fix prevents the **OpenCV `cv2.resize` error** that pops up when trying to process an empty or invalid frame. 

**Before:**
- If a frame was invalid, `cv2.resize` would crash the program, causing errors like:
  ```
  D:/a/opencv-python/opencv-python/opencv/modules/imgproc/src/resize.cpp
  ```
  
**After:**
- Invalid frames are now skipped entirely, and the system moves on to the next frame, ensuring smoother processing without errors. This significantly improves performance and avoids crashes.

#### **3. Improved Performance:**
Skipping invalid or empty frames makes the processing faster and more efficient by preventing the tool from wasting time on frames that would result in errors.
